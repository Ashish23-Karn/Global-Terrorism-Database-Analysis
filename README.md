# Global-Terrorism-Database-Analysis
**--Introduction--**

Terrorist attacks pose a great threat to global security, and their analysis and pattern findings are imperative. According to statistics from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), more than 200,000 terrorist attacks have been recorded from 1970 to the present day. Terrorist attacks typically involve high lethality and destructive power and directly cause massive casualties and property losses. In addition, they bring tremendous psychological pressure on people.

**--Problem aimed to solve--**

The aim of the project is to analyze and provide some useful insights about terrorist attacks happening globally and to create an interactive PowerBi dashboard in the end.

**--Data Description--**

1. Excel Dataset: This folder has an Excel sheet having the cleaned dataset of different countries (.XLSX format).
2. PowerBi: This folder has the final power bi dashboard and the dataset.
   
**--Methodology--**

The project involves collecting and processing different countries' data from the years 1970 to 2017. It utilizes data analysis techniques to have insights about terrorist organizations, weapon types, success rates, and their impact on different regions, and countries. Based on a quantitative statistical analysis of terrorist organization activities in GTD from 1970 to 2017, The project aims to provide some useful insights and pattern findings to study the behavior of these events.

**--Phases--**

1. The dataset was derived from data on terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2017 from the GTD (https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/), which is managed by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). The GTD dataset is considered to be the most comprehensive database for recording global terrorist activity.
2. Data cleaning using Excel/power query Editor
3. Data visualization/Dashboard by using PowerBi

**--DashBoard Creation--**

Here is the Powerbi dashboard which is dynamic in nature and the slicer is added for different years, and countries.

The most suffered countries by terrorist attacks  are "Iraq", followed by "Pakistan" and "India" respectively.
Also, Finland, Romania, and Germany are some of the few major safest European countries to these attacks, while in the middle east UAE and in Asia Vietnam, and Malaysia are the safest.

Almost every sector has an impact of these activities but the most affected ones are "private property and businesses" followed by "military installations" and "police stations".

Most attacks were done by the "Taliban", followed by "ISIL/ISIS" and the primary weapon choice for these terrorist acts was "explosive charges" followed by "small firearms"

Most attacks were done by the "Taliban", followed by "ISIL/ISIS" and the primary weapon choice for these terrorist acts was "explosive charges" followed by "small firearms", Also there was an increase in "Terrorist Attacks"  till 2014, with Peak in 2014(14903), Then continuous decrement.

The most suffered country with the terrorist attacks is "Iraq", followed by "Pakistan" and "India" respectively so it can be concluded and can also be seen that "The Middle East" is the most affected region, followed by "Southeast Asia".

Despite  "explosive charges" as their primary choices, the most success achieved was with "sabotage equipment" and "incendiary".

**--Challenges and learnings--**

1. The main challenge posed by this project was to collect data from reliable sources having complete information.

--Overall, The project can serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, defense enthusiasts, intelligence agencies, and the general public interested in gaining insights about terrorist activities and patterns.
